## Learning Smart Contract - Exercise 1

#### Purpose:
- This exercise will help you to be familiar with:
    - Popular standards in the Ethereum or EVM compatible networks
    - Libraries/Contracts from Openzeppelin
- Logical thinking
- Problem solving
- Error Handling

#### Requirements:
- Write `MultiSender` contract:
    - Transfer multiple assets from `Sender` to multiple `Receivers`
    - Support asset types: Native Coin, ERC-20, and ERC-721
- Contract must be compiled without errors
- Handle common attacks and solid logic implementation
- Gas efficiency (Optional)
- Contract can be deployed to any testnets (Optional):
    - Ethereum testnet: Goerli
        - `RPC: https://goerli.infura.io/v3/`
        - `ChainId: 5`
        - `Block Explorer: https://goerli.etherscan.io`
    - Polygon testnet: Mumbai
        - `RPC: https://matic-mumbai.chainstacklabs.com`
        - `ChainId: 80001`
        - `Block Explorer: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com`
    - Binance Smart Chain: BSC Testnet
        - `RPC: https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/`
        - `ChainId: 97`
        - `Block Explorer: https://testnet.bscscan.com`
    - Fantom testnet
        - `RPC: https://xapi.testnet.fantom.network/lachesis`
        - `ChainId: 4002`
        - `Block Explorer: https://testnet.ftmscan.com/`
    - Avalance testnet: Fuji
        - `RPC: https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
        - `ChainId: 43113`
        - `Block Explorer: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/`
- Logic implementation can be tested locally (Optional)

**Note**: Contract deployment and testing scripts are optional. If you want to try, recommend using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
